We ran the escjava2 tool on checkWonRow, and the first warning it gave was that y could be negative. To solve this we added a loop_invariant that stated that y is always greater than -1.

    //@ loop_invariant (y > -1);

In addition, y could be too large. We solved this with a requires.

    //@ requires row.length == board.ySize;

Finally, there was the problem of rows possibly being null. We added a forall check to catch this error.

    //@ requires (\forall int y; 0 <= y && y < board.ySize; row[y] != null);
